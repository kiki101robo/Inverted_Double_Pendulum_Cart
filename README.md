# Inverted_Double_Pendulum_Cart

## Overview
This project involves the development of a two-load crane control system, implemented as part of the ENPM667 Robotics course. The main objective was to enhance the crane's dynamic response and stability using advanced control algorithms.

## Features
- **Control Algorithms**: Implementation of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control strategies.
- **Simulation**: MATLAB simulations to validate the performance and stability of the control system under various load conditions.
- **Stability Analysis**: Utilization of Lyapunov's indirect method to ensure system stability.
